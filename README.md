# 42-ressources

This github is divided in 2 main parts ; Piscine and Cursus.
The Piscine part is present to help newcommers to understant how 42 works, and to know what could wait them here.
The Cursus part is present to help new students (studs) to realise the projects of CC.

All the ressources that I used for my cursus at 42 Paris + some notes from myself I wrote when I studied the new notions.
