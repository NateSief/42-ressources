# 42-ressources
All the ressources thath I used for my cursus at 42 Paris + some notes from myself I wrote when I studied the new notions

## 1st circle
### . Libft
  A project that asks you to create a library that you'll use during your all cursus and that you'll complete with a lot of functions during your cursus.

  . /!\ Be rigourus with the Makefile, and the bonus rule. </br>
  . /!\ Try to optimise the functions the maximum you can, it'll help you a lot when you'll have to use them after.

  . You have to understand the functionment of each function you're coding, and know how to reproduce them without help.

  #### Ressources :
    . Makefile Tuto : ()[https://github.com/clemedon/Makefile_tutor] </br>
      Very complete tutorial that explain how to make a Makefile for your projects. Very interesting to read and it'll help you to make your Makefile in a good way.

### . Get Next Line (GNL)
  A project that asks you to code a function that read a full line in a document (a line is a string that end with "\n" or the end of the document).
